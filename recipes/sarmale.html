    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This easy recipe for stuffed cabbage or Sarmale is the national dish of Romania and is really loved by Romanian people!</p>
    <p>Christmas, Easter, or even a wedding the Sarmale are of all the great holidays. These are cabbage or vine leaves (marinated in brine or fresh), stuffed with a preparation of meat, rice and spices. It is a festive dish, accompanied by smoked meat, polenta (mamaliga) and a good wine!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Long grain rice</li>
        <li>Ground pork</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley & dill</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        <li>Sour cabbage leaves</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Tomato Juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the filling: Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high. Saute the onions until translucent, then add the rice and toast for 1 minute. Add the pork, salt, pepper, parsley, dill, and the onion mixture to a large bowl and mix well. Use salt sparingly; the cabbage leaves are brined.</li>
        <li>Roll the filling: Remove the cabbage leaves from the brine. You can soak them in water beforehand to draw out some of the salt. Cut each leaf in half and fill the piece with a few tbsp of the meat mixture and roll. Refer to the video in the recipe card to see how I roll these nice and tight. Repeat until all the filling has been used.</li>
        <li>Assemble the rolls: Chop up the remaining cabbage leaves and add them to a large pot or deep roasting dish with a lid. Arrange all the rolls over the chopped cabbage and disperse the bacon evenly among the rolls. Pour the tomato juice over the rolls and top up with some water, if needed, to ensure the rolls are covered with liquid.</li>
        <li>Bake the rolls: Cover the pot with a lid or foil. Bake at 375F for 2 hours, then remove the cover and cook for another 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Serve hot with a side of sour cream.</li>
    </ol>
